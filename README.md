# WGRIB 2

Provides functionality for interacting with, reading, writing, and
manipulating grib2 files, with a CMake build.

See wgrib2 documentation and release page
[here](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib2/).

This release of the wgrib2 package, with CMake build capability, is
part of the [NCEPLIBS](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS) project.

# Users

Wgrib2 is used by the following projects:
* [NOMADS](nomads.ncep.noaa.gov) uses wgrib2 in grib_filter (a wrapper for
   wgrib2) wgrib2 is used to create the *.idx files for random access.
* [global-workflow](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/global-workflow/),
  including post-processing and downstream products. Downstream jobs
  use wgrib2 to regrid GRIB2 files and extract variables. The new
  ocean/ice components will use wgrib2 to convert netCDF files to
  GRIB2 files.
* [Ensemble Verification
  System(EVS)](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/EVS), for processing GRIB2
  files.
* [Rapid Refresh Forecast System
  (RRFS)](https://gsl.noaa.gov/focus-areas/unified_forecast_system/rrfs).
* [The Climate Prediction Center
  (CPC)[(https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/) uses wgrib2 extensively to
  process GRIB2 files in their real-time applications.
* The [MET/METplus](https://dtcenter.org/community-code/metplus)
  software uses wgrib2 to extract information from GRIB2 files.
* The [Global Forecast System
  (GFS)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast)
  post-processing of the atmosphere component has been using wgrib2 to
  interplate the UPP output master files in Gaussian grid into
  pgrb2/pgrb2b files in lat-lon grid.

# Installing

Building wgrib2 requires, CMake, a C compiler, a Fortran compiler
(optional), and various 3rd party libraries depending on build
configuration.

The CMake build provided here supports most build options (NetCDF,
PNG, Jasper, spectral, and ipolates), but not certain features such as
MySQL. If those features are necessary please use the makefile build
provided in the link above.


```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path/to/dependencies
make
make install
```

# Using the wgrib2 library

To use the wgrib2 library the CMake build offers a package config.

After running `find_package(wgrib2)` CMake will generate the following targets for use in your project:

```
wgrib2::wgrib2_lib (c library)
wgrib2::wgrib2_api (fortran target)
```

## Default Build Options

* USE_NETCDF3 = OFF

* USE_NETCDF4 = ON

* USE_REGEX = ON

* USE_TIGGE = ON

* USE_MYSQL = OFF (not yet supported in CMake)

* USE_IPOLATES = 0 (= 3 requires ip2 lib)

* USE_SPECTRAL = OFF (requires SP lib)

* USE_UDF = OFF (not yet supported in CMake)

* USE_OPENMP = OFF

* USE_PROJ4 = OFF (not yet supported in CMake)

* MAKE_FTN_API = ON

* DISABLE_ALARM = OFF

* USE_G2CLIB = OFF (not yet supported in CMake)

* USE_PNG = ON (requires PNG library)

* USE_JASPER = ON (requires Jasper library)

* USE_AEC = OFF (not yet supported in CMake)

              makefiles for wgrib2 upto v3.0.0
                   gnu make v3 vs v4


Gnu make is needed for wgrib2's makefile.  Gnu make v4 (ex. v4.2
and v4.3) is incompatible with the gnu make v3 by the way they
treat the # character.

   foo := $(shell echo '\#abc')
     old gnu make: will print #abc
     new gnu make: will print \#abc 

   fix introduced with v3.0.1 (staight from the gnu make release notes)

   H:=\#
   foo := $(shell echo '$Habc')
     old gnu make: will print #abc
     new gnu make: will print #abc

If want to compile an old version of wgrib2 on a system that
has gnu make v4, you can do one of the following,

   a)  build wgrib2 with gnu make v3.x
   b)  edit grib2/makefile, replace /# by #.
   c)  follow the fix using H:=\# (see above)
        makes the makefile compatible with gnu make v3 and v4.

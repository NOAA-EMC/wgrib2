# WGRIB 2

**This repository is deprecated and will no longer be updated.**

Users are advised to seek other tools due to difficulties building and
maintaining wgrib2. Wgrib2 should not be used in new operational code
at NOAA EMC.

Provides functionality for interacting with, reading, writing, and
manipulating grib2 files, with a CMake build.

See wgrib2 documentation and release page
[here](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib2/).

This release of the wgrib2 package, with CMake build capability, is
part of the [NCEPLIBS](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS) project.

The CMake build provided here supports most build options (NetCDF,
PNG, Jasper, spectral, and ipolates), but not certain features such as
MySQL. If those features are necessary please use the makefile build
provided in the link above.

# Installing

Building wgrib2 requires, CMake, a C compiler, a Fortran compiler
(optional), and various 3rd party libraries depending on build
configuration.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path/to/dependencies
make
make install
```

# Using the wgrib2 library

To use the wgrib2 library the CMake build offers a package config.

After running `find_package(wgrib2)` CMake will generate the following targets for use in your project:

```
wgrib2::wgrib2_lib (c library)
wgrib2::wgrib2_api (fortran target)
```

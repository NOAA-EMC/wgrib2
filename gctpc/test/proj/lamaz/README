Note:  A difference occurs between FORTRAN GCTP and GCTPc at the poles for
Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area(LamAz) when inversing points from LamAz to
lat/long.  The forward transformation of a point 90 (-90) degrees Latitude
with any Longitude to LamAz will be a point.  When inversing this point
from LamAz back to lat/long, GCTPc Latitude will be 90 (-90), however, the
values returned for the Longitude are inconsistent.  FORTRAN GCTP inverse
Latitude and Longitude values were both inconsistent.

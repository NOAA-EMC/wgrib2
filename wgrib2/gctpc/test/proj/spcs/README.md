Note:  State Plane was tested mostly with NAD27 zone code.   However, a few
spot checks were done for NAD83 by hard coating the datam into test.c.  To use
NAD27 zone code set datum = 0; to use NAD83 zone code, set datum = 8.  To run
State Plane with the test program, the global variable $LIBNAD must represent
the directory containing the files NAD27SP or NAD83SP.  

The parameter files used for State Plane include several zones which were
chosen at random.
